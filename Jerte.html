   <h2>THE JERTE VALLEY</h2>
    <p>The Jerte Valley, in northern Extremadura is famous for the cherry blossom in Spring; an amazing spectacle when over two million trees bathe the valley sides in white.</br>
    Following a century-long family custom, the cherries are grown in the traditional way on terraces carved out of the high mountainsides of the Jerte Valley, among crystal-clear springs and pure air. </br>
    Only such a unique spot with a privileged microclimate could grow the best cherries in Spain. </p>

    <p>It's a visual and taste marvel. The gastronomy in extremadura is one of the bests gastornomies in the world. Apart from having the best cherries in Spain and, for some people, the best cherries in the world;</br>
        you have a lot of variety in dishes. You can choose from a garlic soup to high quality lamb, including a very rich and delicious dish called "Gazpacho Extreme√±o", </br>
        created by shepard to survive winter cold in the high mountains</p>
