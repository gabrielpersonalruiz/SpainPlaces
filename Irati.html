        <h1>Magic forest</h1>

            <p class="">
                Irati is a dense green forest mass between mists that barely allows sunlight to pass through,
                a prodigious ecosystem that covers 20,000 hectares of the valleys and mountains in the north of Navarre until it reaches Cize and Soule,
                already in the south of France. The ravishing beauty of this forest,
                made up of beech and spruce for the most part, shows all the shades of green,
                until the spectacle of autumn arrives, in this case, something like a spring tinged with incredible browns.
                The high rate of annual rainfall gives rise to an abundant plant and animal life difficult to match elsewhere.

            <p class="">The Irati Forest is a natural treasure with great ecological value distributed between the north of Navarra and the Atlantic 
                Pyrenees (Sola and Lower Navarra) in the southwest of France. This beautiful natural paradise has many marked trails with varying
                degrees of difficulty and length. Irati has dense beech forests, pastures, fir trees and fresh waters that paint a landscape of
                bright colors in each season. Now in autumn its leaves make up a spectacular watercolor of green, yellow, brown, red, copper and
                reddish.

                Did you know that the American writer and journalist Ernest Hemingway liked to get lost in the Selva de Irati when the San Fermín festivities
                ended? Several legends make this forest a magical place. It is said that among its trees the lament of the ghost of Doña 
                Juana de Albret, mother of King Henry IV of France and III of Navarre, can be heard. Also that of Basajaun (lord of the forest in Basque),
                a character from Basque and Aragonese mythology of prodigious size and strength.
                Esta incomparable joya ambiental ofrece un sinfín de sensaciones: el frescor del río, el sonido huidizo de los animales, el olor a los frutos del bosque,
                 la suavidad del manto de hierba y las hojas caídas en otoño.

            <p>  There are two accesses to the Irati Forest: from Arrazola - Orbaizeta in the Aezkoa valley and from Ochagavía, in the Salazar valley. Nature lovers,
                 tell you that there are guided tours to get to know this unknown and marvelous forest in detail. More practical information at <a href="http://www.irati.org/es/">here</a>
